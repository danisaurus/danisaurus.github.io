					<p><span class="firstLetter">A</span>ccording to Shereef, DBC is looking for us to participate not with a consumer mindset, but instead with a "kitchen" mindset. We are all in this together and have a sense of responsibility and ownership over the whole environment.</p>

					<p>From what I can tell, DBC is about coming in and leaving everything on the table and taking every opportunity to learn, to excel, and to positively impact our own educational experience. We are in charge of our own educations and we have the ability of impacting the program for future cohorts.</p>

					<p>On that note: I'm freaking out a little. Is anyone else freaking out a little?</p>

					<p>Overall I am fearful and excited at the same time. I think the greatest thing that Shereef said was that we aren't competing with each other, but we are kicking our own asses and providing safety and support to those around us.  I'm excited for Dev Bootcamp once I get to Chicago, however, I'm feeling totally overwhelmed by DevBootcamp right now. I'm having to completely redevelop the way my brain thinks in terms of time management, research, writing, and feedback. Is anyone else struggling with getting all of the work done while working a full time job? In preparation for taking a leave of absense from my job I'm finding myself working a lot of overtime along with attempting to do all the homework. What tips do people have for managing your time and being able to get all the work done? How do you do all the work that needs to get done, and still get sleep?</p>
