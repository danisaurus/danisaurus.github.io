					<p>The main issue that Ted has, is its ability to display a large amount of recently uploaded content in one place without overwelming the consumer. Ted wants it to be easy to browse new and old videos, and to find the sort of talks that are interesting for you. To do this and keep the page extremely clean (and all important videos above the fold) Ted has created a visual list of their videos in a sort of random pinterest sort of styling with different sizes based on importance of new talks. They then have a very visual que that if you aren't seeing something you want right away, that you can scroll right for more videos. I think this is a great way of providing all the content they want without trying to fit it all on one page at the same time. Ted obviously follows a very clean grid system as well. </p>
