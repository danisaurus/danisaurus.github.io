					<h3>Basic Rules of Design</h3>
					<p>Good designs follow a basic set of rules. Although many consider there to be over twenty rules, I believe that good design can be boiled down to the following: </p>
					<ol>
						<li><h4>Form Follows Function</h4>
							<p>Design is determined by intention. Ask yourself the following questions before beginning a design:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Who is it for?</li>
								<li>What is it intended to do?</li>
								<li>What is it intended to convey?</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li><h4>Simple Is Better</h4>
							<p>Always remember, white space is magical. Use the following tips to make sure your design only includes the most important elements</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Have a reason for every design element.</li>
								<li>Use clear, meaningful, language.</li>
								<li>Use images and copy that support the message. Leave them out if they don’t.</li>
								<li>Choose colors that compliment the message instead of taking away from it.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li><h4>Communicate. Don't Decorate</h4>
							<ul>
								<li>Good designs should never overwhelm or confuse the user with unneeded information.</li>
								<li>“I like it” is never a good reason to include an element in your design.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li><h4>Be Consistent</h4>
							<ul>
								<li>Your design should incorporate internal and external components and behaviors that are familiar to your audience.</li>
								<li>If the user already understands the element, they don’t need to rethink and remember.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ol>
					<p>At the end of the day when you are considering design elements and a user experience. Think about these four prinicples: Usablility, Readability, Scalability, Consistency.</p>
